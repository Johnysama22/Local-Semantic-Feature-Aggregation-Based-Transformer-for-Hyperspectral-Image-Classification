Local Semantic Feature Aggregation-Based Transformer for Hyperspectral Image Classification

The code in this toolbox implements the ["Local Semantic Feature Aggregation-Based Transformer for Hyperspectral Image Classification"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9864609). The code may easy to understand. 

How to use it?
---------------------
Here an example experiment is given by using **Pavia University hyperspectral data**. Directly run **main.py** functions with different network parameter settings to produce the results. Please note that due to the randomness of the parameter initialization, the experimental results might have slightly different from those reported in the paper. You can adjust the network in **model.py** functions.

Dataset path
---------------------
 ```
|--main.py
|--model.py
|--data
|  |--PaviaU.mat
|  |--PaviaU_gt.mat
```

System-specific notes
---------------------
The codes of networks were tested using PyTorch 1.9 version (CUDA 10.2) in Python 3.7 on Window 10 system.
